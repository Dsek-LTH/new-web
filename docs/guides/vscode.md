# How to setup VS Code

We rely on quite a few extensions to make our development experience better. By following the steps below, you can install all the recommended extensions.

## Prerequisites

The following guide assumes you have [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed. If you don't, you can download it from the link above. You should also have followed the steps in the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide, especially the part about cloning the repository.

## Steps

1. Open the repository in VS Code.
   ```bash
   code dsek-web
   ```
2. Install the recommended extensions by clicking on the "Install" button in the notification that appears at the bottom of the window.
   If the notification doesn't appear, you can install the extensions manually by clicking on the "Extensions" icon in the sidebar and searching for `@recommended`.
