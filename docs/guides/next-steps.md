# How to take your next steps

Now that you've set up your development environment, it's time to begin coding! Here are some steps you can follow to open your first pull request.

1. **If you're completely new to web development**, it might feel overwhelming to jump into a project like this. In that case, we recommend that you start by reading through the [tutorials](../tutorials/html.md) to get a better understanding of the basics of web development.

2. **Visit the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/Dsek-LTH/projects/7/views/8)** and pick a task that you would like to work on. Issues are categorized by their size so you can choose one that fits your skill level. Sometimes there are issues marked as "good first issue". These are a great place to start if you're new to the project.

3. **Get comfortable with navigating the codebase.** CTRL+P is your friend. Use it to quickly navigate to files by typing their name. For instance, if you're tasked with making a change to the `/news` page, you can simply type `news +page` and press enter to open the corresponding `+page.svelte` file. Often you will find that the code you are looking for is hidden in some function. Holding down `CTRL` while clicking on function names or variables will take you to their definition.

4. **Make your changes.** Once you've found the file(s) you want to edit, make your changes. If you're unsure about something, don't hesitate to ask for help!

5. **Commit your changes.** Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to a new branch in your local repository.

6. **Push your changes.** Push your changes. If you're not a member of the DWWW organization, you will need to [fork the repository](https://github.com/Dsek-LTH/web/fork) and push your changes to your fork instead.

7. **Open a pull request.** Go to the [main repository](https://github.com/Dsek-LTH/web) and open a pull request. Make sure to describe what you've done and why you've done it. If your pull request is related to an issue, make sure to reference it in the description.
