Follow the steps below to get a local development enviornment up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you get up and running, you need to install the following software.
You need to install the following tools by following the instructions on their respective websites.

<Aside type="tip" title="Using Windows?">
   If you're running Windows, it's highly recommended to first install **WSL**. This sets up a Linux environment on your Windows machine and simplifies development.

   <LinkCard

   target="_blank"
   />
</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Head over to the installation page for **Node.js**.

     description="Install Node.js LTS. Using nvm is recommended, but not required."
     href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"
     target="_blank"
   />

   When the installation is complete, open a terminal and ensure everything works as expected. Your output may vary.

   ```bash
   > node -v
   v20.16.0
   ```

2. Now, install the package manager **pnpm**.

     description="Installing pnpm using Corepack is strongly recommended."

   />

   When the installation is complete, open a terminal and ensure everything works as expected. Your output may vary.

   ```bash
   > pnpm -v
   9.6.0
   ```

3. Finally, install **Docker Desktop**.

     href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/"
     target="_blank"
   />

   When the installation is complete, open a terminal and ensure everything works as expected. Your output may vary.

   ```bash
   > docker -v
   Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
   ```

</Steps>

## Installation

<Steps>

1. Clone the repo into `dsek-web` and change into the directory.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dsek-LTH/web.git dsek-web && cd dsek-web
   ```
2. Install all dependencies using `pnpm`.
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Setup your local development database. [Having problems?](#troubleshooting)

   ```bash
   sh ./dev/setup_db.sh
   ```

4. Start the development server.

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Congratulations! You should now be able to visit your application on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Troubleshooting

export const setupDbCode = await fetch(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dsek-LTH/web/main/dev/setup_db.sh",
).then((response) => response.text());

Issues commonly occur when setting up the local development database. Usually, this shows up either as errors when running `sh ./dev/setup_db.sh` or as simply not seeing any data when the development server starts. Here are some steps you can try to fix the problem:

<Steps>

1. Begin by deleting the local database. Open Docker Desktop and delete `dsek-db` (or use the command below).

   ```bash title="Docker CLI (alternative)"
   docker rm --force dsek-db
   ```

2. Option 1: If you noticed permission errors while running `sh ./dev/setup_db.sh`, try running the script using `sudo`.

   ```bash
   sudo sh ./dev/setup_db.sh
   ```

3. Option 2: You can always try to run the commands in the script manually. This makes it easier to troubleshoot what's going on. Open a terminal and run the commands one-by-one.

   Note that some commands span multiple lines! Backslashes `\` are used to break a command into multiple lines.
