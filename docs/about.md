# About

This documentation site strives to follow the excellent [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) framework for writing documentation. Its structure is briefly outlined below for readers of this site. but if you are authoring documentation you should visit the relevant sections linked below.

## Guides

_"Guides are **goal-oriented**. They are directions that guide the reader through a problem or towards a result. How-to guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish things: the list of how-to guides in your documentation helps frame the picture of what your product can actually do."_

## Tutorials

_"A tutorial is always **learning-oriented**. It is a practical activity, in which the student learns by doing something meaningful, towards some achievable goal. It’s important to understand that while a student will learn by doing, what the student does is not necessarily what they learn."_

## Explanation

_"Explanation is **understanding-oriented**. It deepens and broadens the reader’s understanding of a subject. In explanation, you’re not giving instruction or describing facts - you’re opening up the topic for consideration. It helps to think of explanation as discussion: discussions can even consider and weigh up contrary opinions."_

## Reference

_"Reference material is **information-oriented**. It is a technical description of the machinery and how to operate it. It should be austere. One hardly reads reference material; one consults it."_
