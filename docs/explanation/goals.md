# About our overall goals

**Simplicity** is key. We are a small team working part-time on this project. We need to be able to onboard new developers quickly every year. We want everyone to be able to contribute to the project, regardless of their experience level. Therefore, complex features should be avoided and we should instead try to find simple and understandable solutions. Additional libraries and frameworks should be avoided unless they undeniably make our lives easier. Simplicity is key to both the longevity of the project and our ability to create a community of members who can contribute to the project.

**Stability** is equally important. The entire D-guild expects our systems to be operational at all times and we need to be able to quickly fix any issues that arise. This means that we avoid using experimental technologies and libraries. We also avoid using technologies that are not well supported by the community. Without stability, we risk losing the trust of our users.

**Learning** is a core part of our project. As a student organization for computer science/informatics, we should create a project that allows our members to learn technologies and common practices. We should also create a project that allows our members to learn how to work in a team and how to contribute to a project. This means that we should avoid using technologies that are not widely used in the industry.
