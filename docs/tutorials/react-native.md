# React Native

React Native is a framework for building mobile applications for iOS and Android. It uses a similar design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. Learn React Native at [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).

### React Native example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Text, View } from "react-native";

const YourApp = () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignItems: "center",
      }}
    >
      <Text>Try editing me! ðŸŽ‰</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default YourApp;
```
